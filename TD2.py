# EX1: Shared Memory - FIBONACCI RETURN
"""
In Exercise 1 from Session 1, the child process had to output the Fibonacci sequence it generated because 
the parent and child have their own copies of data. Another approach to designing this program is to establish 
a shared-memory object between the parent and child processes. This technique allows the child to write the contents 
of the sequence to the shared-memory object. The parent can then output the sequence when the child completes. 

Write a Python program to implement this scenario using either the direct shared memory approach or the manager approach. 
You can reuse parts of your solution for the previous exercise.

# Ex2: Message Passing - Is it time yet?
"""
Weâ€™d like to implement a time server that creates a message queue and listens on it. 
It understands 2 types of messages, 1 and 2. Messages of type 1 are time requests. 
Upon receiving a time request, the server reads the system clock (see time.asctime()), 
and sends it into the queue as message type 3. A message of type 2 is a termination request. 
Upon receiving it, the server removes the message queue and terminates. 
The client program connects to the message queue, prompts the user for the message type to 
send to the server and communicates with the latter accordingly. Upon receiving a message from 
the server in response to a time request, it displays the message on the terminal. 
Implement the server and the client programs using the message passing facilities of the sysv_ipc module. Test with multiple clients.
